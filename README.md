# ft_ls
A partial re-implementation of the unix "ls" command implemented in C.

## Description
The goal of this project is to discover a sub-system of functions of operating systemâ€™s API, the associated data structures, as well as the management of memory allocation and the associated data.

The implemented functionality closely mocks the behaviour found in `man ls`.

For a more thorough description and list of requirements (such as allowed functions) look at "ft_ls.en.pdf".

### Functionality
The command has the following usage:
`ft_ls [-alrRt] [files ...]`

#### Supported flags:
`-a` : Include hidden directory entries.

`-l` : List in long format.

`-r` : Reverse the order of the sort.

`-R` : Recursively list subdirectroies encountered.

`-t` : Sort by time modified (most recently modified first) before sorting the operands by lexicographical order.

### Usage
```
$ make
```

```
$ ./ft_ls [command flags ...] [files ...]
```
